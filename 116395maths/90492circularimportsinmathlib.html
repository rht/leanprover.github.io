<p>Johannes said in the p-adic PR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm fine with merging, with one exception: Please don't import topology in <code>data/polynomial</code>. I guess we need a <code>analysis/polynomial.lean</code> for the continuity statement.</p>
<p>I don't like this, as we get into a huge mess if we have too much cyclic dependencies between the top level directories. I think <code>data</code> shouldn't depend on <code>analysis</code> or the <code>*_theory</code> directories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've never thought about these issues. Are there general rules written down somewhere about what is acceptable and what is not when it comes to this sort of question?</p>
