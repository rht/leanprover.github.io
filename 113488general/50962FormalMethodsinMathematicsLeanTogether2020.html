<p>I'd like to remind everyone that Rob Lewis and I are organizing a meeting at Carnegie Mellon from Monday, January 6 to Friday, January 10: <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/" target="_blank" title="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/">http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/</a>. Monday to Wednesday will feature invited speakers on a range of topics (with a break on Wednesday afternoon), and Thursday and Friday will be a Lean workshop.</p>
<p>Rob and I are starting to think about how to block out the time for Thursday and Friday. Here are some things we want to fit in:<br>
- A presentation on Lean 4 from Sebastian Ullrich and a subsequent discussion.<br>
- A discussion of plans for <code>mathlib</code>, as well as infrastructure and tools for maintaining it.<br>
- A discussion of the Formal Abstracts project.<br>
- Short, informal presentations of recent work and work in progress.<br>
If any of you have other suggestions for things we should budget time for, please let us know.</p>

<p>Is there any possibility of a recording/stream?</p>

<p>Yes, we should have both live streaming and recording, assuming the technology works.</p>
