<p>Advocacy is volunteering, or so goes the open source mantra. I've advocated for better documentations so...</p>
<p>I've scraped the 89 thousand lines of this chat room (back to May 23, it wouldn't go back any further). Since a new semester has started it seems that new user questions are on the rise. Since I'm also struggling to climb the "smooth wall" of Lean I thought I'd write a new user guide based on questions and answers in this chat room. I hope to have a draft by the January meeting.</p>
