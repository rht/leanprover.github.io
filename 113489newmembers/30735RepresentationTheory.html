<p>I was reading through a Representation Theory textbook and a question came to my mind: Have the theory been implemented in any LEAN library?</p>

<p>No, there's essentially no representation theory at this point (although there is some commutative algebra).</p>

<p>Thank you for answering. If so, how much it will be worth (for this community) to implement the theory in a library? It's a classical theory, but the fact that it is not yet implemented seems to somewhat imply that there are more urgent needs for other theories now. I want to know the context if any exists.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="242240">@Jineon Baek</span> It only somewhat implies that we don't have enough people power. It's a relatively small group of contributors, and they just hack on whatever they think is fun.</p>

<p>There are several people on this chat that think that representation theory is extremely important. But we just haven't got round to doing anything so far.</p>

<p>Yes, I'd love to see some! A lot depends on what generality you want to do things in, and often for mathlib the answer is "a lot of generality".</p>

<p>The theory of abelian categories is on the horizon, and might be useful to have in place, so if someone wants to work on that I'd be happy to provide some pointers (and get around to doing some of the things I promised to do).</p>

<p>Thanks for the input everyone! I'm a newbie both in this lean game and representation theory, so I'm thinking of learning both by implementing theorems in a textbook as I learn them like the 'intro to proof' course project.</p>

<p>Full generality is definitely what standard library should aim for though. If my own little project works out well I'll share. Would happy to hear pointers for a starting point. I'm wondering if I should give it a try for finite group rep. with finite dimensional vector space first, or in a bit more generality.</p>

<p>Why not try to prove the first interesting thing about finite group representations: averaging over the group is the projection onto the trivial isotypic component?</p>

<p>Representation theory is one of the many things on my list of stuff we need to get done at some point. It's a beautiful theory, and essentially self-contained. The first part of Serre's book would be the kind of goal we'd need</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>  When we developed Axiom at IBM Research there was an effort made to invite and actively support people who worked in areas where we needed implementations, for example, in finite fields. It might be interesting to "talent search" among mathematicians and actively recruit their participation. Perhaps Microsoft could be convinced to do a "Microsoft Summer of Code", providing a summer support program for mathematicians with proposals for lean development.</p>

<p>I don't think we need a "person who works in representation theory" -- all we need is an intelligent undergraduate who is trained in type theory and is interested, and I'm sure I'll find one in the end.</p>
