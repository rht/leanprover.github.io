<p>Hey guys, I want to ask about the cardinality of sets. I'm totally newbie to Lean so the questions might be trivial and silly. Still, I need your help. </p>
<p>I would like to ask what is the function in mathlib that returns the number of elements of a set (of type set \N and not finset, but this set  surely has a finite number of elements, it's not infinite set like R or N) and also which file i should have to import. </p>
<p>Thank you for your responses. </p>
<p>P.S.: I'm from Vn so please excuse-me for my English too.</p>
